Data Collection
===============

The data collection process for I-Coach involves systematic recording and acquisition of exercise video data to train robust machine learning models for exercise recognition and form analysis.

Collection Methodology
----------------------

Video Recording Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Camera Configuration**

- Outdoor fitness areas (when applicable)
- Multiple camera angles for comprehensive coverage

Exercise Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system collects data for five primary exercise categories:

1. **Bench Press**
   - Variations: Standard, incline, decline
   - Weight ranges: Bodyweight to advanced loads
   - Form variations: Proper and common error patterns

2. **Hammer Curl**
   - Arm positions: Standing, seated
   - Weight types: Dumbbells, cables, resistance bands
   - Tempo variations: Slow, controlled, explosive

3. **Pull Up**
   - Grip variations: Wide, narrow, neutral
   - Assistance levels: Unassisted, assisted, negative
   - Bar types: Standard, assisted machines

4. **Push-up**
   - Variations: Standard, wide, diamond, incline, decline
   - Difficulty levels: Beginner to advanced
   - Form deviations: Common mistakes and corrections

5. **Squat**
   - Types: Bodyweight, weighted, goblet, back squat
   - Depth variations: Partial, parallel, deep
   - Stance widths: Narrow, standard, wide
